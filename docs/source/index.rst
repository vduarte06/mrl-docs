MRL Documentation
=================

MRL is domain specific language (DSL) that aims to improve medical exams report writing.

1. Getting started
==================
To introduce MRL, lets create a simple MRL report for a Polisonomgraphy study (PSG) as follows:

1. Create a file with the extension ``.mrl``
2. add the following code. Make sure you have the file name correctly linked to the report in order to access the exam results within your report.
3. Compile the report. 

Example:

.. code-block:: ruby

    from utils import Diagnosis;
    Identification:
        patientName: 'Patient Name';
        Birthdate: '01-01-2000';

    Recording:
        name: 'exam.edf'
        type: 'PSG'

    Results:
        Respiration: IAH, ODI;

    Conclusions:
        Diagnosis: Diagnosis.SAOS.severe;
        Recomendatios: CPAP;


The result will be a beaultiful, objective and uniformized PSG report.

2. MRL Basics
=============

2.1. Variables
-------------
When an exam is imported, multiple variables will be availabe in the environment of MRL.
E.g. if we want to know the Apnea/Hipopnea Index (AHI) we can simply state AHI to access this variable.

We can also create our own variable asignments, as shown in the following exame:
.. code-block:: python
    arg = 1;
    functionOutput = someFunctionOutput(arg);



2.2. Functions
---------
MRL doenst support general purpose programming but allows the user to import functions implemented in other languages. 

MRL ships with Python integration.
Python was chosen to be the default language because it has great libraries for signal processing and is easy to learn.

In summary: functions must be implemented in Python and then connected to MRL. They will send it to python as pipe message.

In the following example we implemented a function ``getAge(date)`` and connect we connect it to MRL.

.. code-block:: javascript

    function getAge(date) -> call python_module.get_age date;


2.3. Objects
------------
The concept of objects is usefull for programmers who are integrating the language into a system. 
A healthcare professional writing a report doesn't need to worry about the concept of objects but will be able to take advantage of this abstraction while writing reports.

Objects are represented in a simple ``key:value`` form. E.g.

.. code-block:: ruby

    Person:
        name: 'Patient Name';
        Birthdate: '01-01-2000';

The propeties of objects can be accessed with dot.
``
Person.name
``

The reserved word ``this`` refers to the current object while constructing an object.. E.g.

.. code-block:: ruby

    PatientIdentification:
        name: 'Patient Name';
        Birthdate: '01-01-2000';
        ...
        previousReports: getPreviousReports(this);

In the example above the properties of the object PatientIdentification will be used to get the previous reports of that patients using a function.


2.4. Creating a report
-----------------
A MRL report has at least 4 mandatory blocks: Identification, RecordingInfo, Results, Conclusion.

A report must start with an identification block, which can be created as follows:

.. code-block:: ruby

    Identification:
        patientName: 'Patient Name';
        Birthdate: '08-06-1992';
        Age: age(this.Birthdate);
        ClinicalHistory: 
            Summary: 'Fumador, hipersonolÃªncia diurna';
            PreviousReport: PreviousReport(this);
