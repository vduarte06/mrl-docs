4. Creating reports
===================

A MRL report has at least 4 mandatory sections: ``ExamInfo, Identification; Results and Conclusion.``

4.1. Exam Information
---------------------

.. code-block:: ruby

    # Recording:
        Equipment: 'Nox';
        Channels: EEG, EMG, PSG, ECG;
        StartDateTime: 1/1/2022;
        EndDatetime: 2/2/2022;
    end

We start by identifing the exam:


This will allow MRL to access the exam variables

4.2. Patient Identification
---------------------------

MRL will read the patient information from the exam file. 
However, if any identification information is missing in the exam file you will have to fill it in manually as the following example:

.. code-block:: ruby

    #Identification:
        patientName: 'Patient Name';
        Birthdate: '08-06-1992';
        Age: age(this.Birthdate);
        Summary: 'Fumador, hipersonolÃªncia diurna';
        PreviousReport: PreviousReport(this);
    end

4.3. Results
------------

The results section is basically a selection of the variables to be shown in the report.
We can group them in categories of findings. Tipical categories of results in a PSG are Respiration, Sleep Architecture, Movement Sleep Disorders, and so on.

This section is usually filled by a sleep technician.

.. code-block:: ruby

    #Results:
        Respiration: IAH, ODI;
        SleepArchitecture: SleepTime, Arousals, SleepPhases;
        Movement:  
            LegMovements, 
            'Legs vs Arousals' : correlate(LegMovement, Arousals); 
    end


4.3. Conclusions
----------------

A physician will look at the results and make conclusions.

There are a limited range of diagnosis you can make from a PSG exam. 

In the following example we show how a physician can diagnose a patient with Severe Obstructive Sleep Apnea (SOSA) and prescribe Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) Therapy.

.. code-block:: ruby

    #Conclusions:
        Diagnosis: Diagnosis.SOSA.severe;
        Recomendatios: CPAP;
    end
