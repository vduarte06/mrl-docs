Implementing functions
======================

MRL doenst support general purpose programming, but allows the user to import functions implemented in other languages
The following example ilustrates an itegration with Python:

.. code-block:: ruby

   # FILE: api.mrl
   

   from python.api import call;
   import numpy; 
   import custom; # user defined module. Could be any name

   function correlate(arg1*) -> call numpy.correlate args*; # this maps a mrl function to a numpy function
   function age(date) -> call custom.age date; # this maps a mrl function to a function in the module custom.py

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: generated

Python was chosen because it has great libraries for signal processing.
